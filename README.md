# HookDrop

POST a webhook to `/h/<bucket>`. It catches it. You inspect it.

That's the app. The interesting part is everything running behind it.

---

## What It Does

Five routes:

- `POST /h/<bucket>` — receives any webhook, stores it in memory
- `GET /h/<bucket>` — returns the last 50 events for that bucket
- `GET /h/<bucket>/stream` — SSE stream, new events pushed live
- `GET /healthz` / `GET /readyz` — liveness and readiness probes
- `GET /` — usage hints

Each stored event has a trace ID, the bucket name, method, headers, body, source IP, and timestamp. The store is in-memory only — no database, no Redis. 50 events per bucket, oldest dropped first.

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted a project small enough to understand completely but with enough moving parts to build a real DevOps pipeline around. A webhook receiver fits that. The app itself is ~300 lines of Go. Everything else — the CI, the GitOps loop, the security layer — is the actual point.

## Stack

**Frontend**
- Server-rendered dashboard in Go (`handler/dashboard.go`) — usage hints, bucket URLs
- SSE stream at `/h/<bucket>/stream` — new webhooks pushed live to the browser, no polling

**Backend**
- Go 1.22, stdlib `net/http` only (no Gin, no Echo)
- `zerolog` for structured JSON logging, trace ID on every request
- In-memory ring buffer, 50 events per bucket, thread-safe with `sync.RWMutex`
- Graceful shutdown on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, 10 second drain window

**DevOps**
- Docker: multi-stage build, distroless final image, non-root UID 65532, read-only root filesystem
- GitHub Actions: lint → test → Trivy image scan → Trivy Helm config scan → build → push ECR → update `values-prod.yaml`
- AWS ECR: image registry, SHA-tagged on every push
- Helm 3: separate `values-local.yaml` and `values-prod.yaml`, HPA with properly set requests so autoscaling actually works
- ArgoCD: GitOps sync, auto-prune, self-heal — cluster state always matches git
- kind: local Kubernetes cluster, EKS-compatible manifests
- Kyverno: two admission policies — no `latest` tags, required resource limits, both enforced not just documented
- Bitnami Sealed Secrets: secrets encrypted before they touch git

## Local Setup

You need: Go 1.22, Docker, kind, kubectl, helm, argocd CLI, golangci-lint, trivy

```bash
# Just run the app
go run ./...
# POST http://localhost:8080/h/test
# GET  http://localhost:8080/h/test

# Or with Docker
make docker-run

# Full local cluster
make cluster-up
kubectl apply -f k8s/argocd/application.yaml
```

The local ArgoCD Application uses `values-local.yaml` which points to `hookdrop:local` with `pullPolicy: Never`. To get an image into the cluster:

```bash
docker build -t hookdrop:local .
kind load docker-image hookdrop:local --name hookdrop
```

No pull secrets, no ECR auth, no token expiry headaches locally. ECR is only in the CI/production path where it makes sense — EKS nodes pull via IAM automatically.

---

## CI/CD Flow

```
git push to main
  → lint + test
  → docker build
  → trivy image scan     (fails CI on HIGH/CRITICAL)
  → trivy config scan    (fails CI on Helm misconfigs)
  → push to ECR          (tagged sha-<commit>)
  → update values-prod.yaml image.tag
  → ArgoCD detects drift
  → syncs Helm chart to cluster
  → new pod rolls out
```

The cluster updates itself. Nothing manual after the push.

---

## Security Choices

- Distroless image — no shell, no package manager, smaller CVE surface
- Non-root UID 65532, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, all capabilities dropped, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`
- Trivy runs on both the image and the Helm chart in CI, not just one
- Kyverno rejects pods at admission if they use `latest` tag or missing resource limits — enforced, not just documented
- Sealed Secrets encrypts anything sensitive before it touches git

---

## Two Deployment Profiles

| | Local (kind) | Production (EKS) |
|---|---|---|
| Image | `hookdrop:local` | ECR URI + SHA tag |
| Pull policy | `Never` | `Always` |
| Auth | None | IAM role on node |
| Ingress | Disabled | Enabled |
| Values file | `values-local.yaml` | `values-prod.yaml` |

Switch the ArgoCD Application to `values-prod.yaml` for the production path.

## Troubleshooting

**`ImagePullBackOff` on kind**
The cluster is using the prod values file and trying to hit ECR. Check that `k8s/argocd/application.yaml` references `values-local.yaml`, not `values-prod.yaml`. Then load the local image: `kind load docker-image hookdrop:local --name hookdrop`.

**ArgoCD shows OutOfSync but won't sync**
Usually a Kyverno policy block. Run `kubectl describe pod <pod> -n hookdrop` and check events — it'll say which policy failed.

**Kyverno blocking your pod**
Either missing resource limits or using `latest` tag. Both are intentional. Fix the values file, not the policy.
